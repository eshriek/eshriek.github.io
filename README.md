This is the test directory for a repository of fiction literature to ensure shit happens. The emphasis on *test* should not be underestimated. The goal here will be bulk. Lots of words. None of the words here need have any relavance, meaning, direction, or coherence. Hardcore fiction writers can do 3000 or more in a day, most days. Note, those are 3000 fully edited words ready for print. No one will ever push anything like that here. I'll take a page from James Clear, Atomic Habits, how many words can be done in 2 minutes for the next 20 days? I'm thinking I won't see 300. And they will be unedited and dismal.
